pycdec is a Python interface to cdec

## Installation

Build and install pycdec:

	python setup.py install

## Grammar extractor

Compile a parallel corpus and a word alignment into a suffix array representation:

	python -m cdec.sa.compile -f f.txt -e e.txt -a a.txt -o output/ -c extract.ini

Extract grammar rules from the compiled corpus:
	
	cat input.txt | python -m cdec.sa.extract -c extract.ini -g grammars/

This will create per-sentence grammar files in the `grammars` directory and output annotated input suitable for translation with cdec.
	
## Library usage

A basic demo of pycdec's features is available in `test.py`

More documentation will come as the API becomes stable.
