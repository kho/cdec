To build cdec, you'll need:

 * boost headers & boost program_options (you may need to install a package
    like boost-devel)


Instructions for building
-----------------------------------

 1) Use automake / autoconf to generate the configure script.
    I'm not an expert at using these tools, but this should be sufficient:

        autoreconf -ifv

 2) Configure and build.  Your command will look something like this.

        ./configure
        make

    If you get errors during configure about missing BOOST macros, then step 3
    failed, and you need to keep working at it.  If you get errors during the
    build, it's probably a problem with step 3 or possibly with some compiler
    version idiosyncracies (generally, I assume you have a relatively new
    of g++).

    If you're building on cygwin, their libtool is buggy; this make command
    works for now:

        make LIBS+="-lz -lboost_program_options" \
             CFLAGS+="-Wno-sign-compare"

 3) Test

        ./tests/run-system-tests.pl

    Everything should pass.


 4) Enjoy!
